#### Demonstrate your system, prototype, proof of concept, or a piece of your system in action. If you have no working code, be sure to show a design of your system.

_Demo_

#### Discuss why this project is interesting to you!

_I have been listening to self help books and was inspired to create this sort of app so that I can become more consistent and develop good, daily habits. I feel like I have so many things that I wish I was doing, so I wanted to create an app that could help me keep track of my progress and work towards goals._

#### Summary of the project (one to three sentences)

_HappyHabits is an app that will help you track your daily habits and keep logs of how well you are keeping them. The app will use AI to analyze the user's effective habit patterns (when are they the most productive / likely to complete a goal) and provide insight on the progress being made. Notifications help to motivate and keep you on track._
